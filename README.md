This project is about implementing Explainable AI specifically LIME on 3 different ML algorithms : Decision Tree , Random Forest Classifier and SVM. 
The ipynb files of these 3 Algorithms are hence uploaded.
For more detailed description on the code's output and about LIME, I have uploaded the ppt for the same (titled XAI - ppt).
